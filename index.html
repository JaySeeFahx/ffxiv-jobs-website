        <section class="container ffxiv-intro">
            <p class="game-info sec1">FFXIV (Final Fantasy 14) is an online MMORPG that has been growing in popularity since it's second iteration, A Realm Reborn, was introduced back in 2013. Available on consoles and PC, it is a widely enjoyed game that allows a person to become any one of 8 races to explore the world of Eorzea.</p>
            <p class="game-info sec2">Once you've picked a race, you may then choose a starting class, of which there are 9. One of the biggest draws to many players is the ability to unlock every class/job available on only one character! The first MMORPG to offer this kind of incentive to play.</p>
            <p class="game-info sec3">After leveling sufficiently, and getting through enough story, the world opens up and allows the player to begin picking jobs like Black Mage, or Dragoon. Each new expansion offers more story, more lands to explore, and more jobs to play.</p>
